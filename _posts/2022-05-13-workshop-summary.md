Two weeks ago we held the first US-RSE Community Building Workshop, in Princeton, NJ.
50 community members spent two full days discussing pertinent issues around RSEs and the US-RSE organization.
The energy was palpable and a significant amount of work was accomplished - but there is still much to do.


Breakout working group sessions focused on specific topics related to US-RSE’s 4-pronged [mission](https://us-rse.org/about/mission/) (Community, Advocacy, Resources, DEI) as well as US-RSE’s internal organizational structure.
Each group had the specific goal to produce tangible outputs such as blog posts, white papers, or concrete plans for a future event.
Because the workshop space was limited, we were aware that not everyone in the community was able to participate.
As a result, over the next month, we aim to bring as much as possible back to the US-RSE community for input, contribution, and feedback as the outputs are completed.


Expect ongoing discussions to happen in dedicated sack channels in US-RSE’s slack workspace.
Because of the number of topics, this is the best way to keep focused discussion without overwhelming emails, #general, or another catch-all channel.
Over the next few days/weeks, specific breakout session groups will share what contribution opportunities exist and how to best contribute.
We openly encourage everyone to join in the conversation!


Breakout working group topics included:
* Career Path and Professional Development
* Guidelines and Structure for US-RSE Working & Affinity Groups
* Regional US-RSE Groups
* Steering Committee Leadership Processes for Diversity - opportunities and awareness
* Steering Committee Leadership Processes for Diversity - nomination approach
* US-RSE financial sustainability
* Elevating the Stature of RSEs Within the Broader Community
* Hiring RSEs (e.g. retention, diversity, salaries)
* Forming an RSE Group (metrics, funding, business models, case to leadership)
* Education & Training
* Infrastructure and tooling to support RSEs
* Planning an in-person Fall Workshop around Hiring RSEs and Data Scientists (US-RSE & ADSA)
* 2023 US-RSE Conference Planning
* RSEs in National Labs


Keep an eye on slack over the next week for individual topic updates and opportunities to contribute!
