Thank you to everyone who expressed interest in attending the
workshop. We received significantly more applicants
than we are able to support.

We are striving to accommodate as many as possible, but workshop space
is limited and we are committed to ensuring a broadly diverse
participant group, both in terms of traditional diversity measures as
well as research domain and institutional representation.

We are not able to offer a remote or hybrid option, however,
US-RSE is a virtual organization and will continue to offer opportunities
for virtual events and participation throughout the year.
