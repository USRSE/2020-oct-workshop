We understand that not everyone in the community will be able to attend the
workshop in person. While we will not be able to offer a remote attendance
option, we do anticipate being able to offer some degree of asynchronous
participation remotely both before and after the workshop.  

Information about how to contribute topics for breakout discussion and/or
content generation (see [About -> Overview & Goals]({{ site.baseurl }}/about) for the goals and outputs of the
workshop) will be hosted on this page as the workshop gets closer.
